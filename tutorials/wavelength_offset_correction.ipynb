    "# Wavelength offset corrections\n",
    "\n",
    "The wavelength calibration of spectroscopic data is usually based on spectral lamp exposures with known emission lines. Although the calibration may achieve very accurate results, there are some issues that could affect the final calibration of the scientific data. For example:\n",
    "- The optical path between the lamps and the on-sky sources is different.\n",
    "- The number of emission lines detected in the exposure frame is insufficient for deriving a robust calibration.\n",
    "- The modelling of the spectral distorsion does not capture all the complexities of an instrument.\n",
    "\n",
    "These potential issues may result into an inhomogeneous wavelength calibration of IFS data. Correcting for systematic offsets between fibres, as well as different profiles of the instrumental LSF, is key for performing detailed scientific analyses (e.g., gas/stellar kinematics).\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook illustrates how can `pykoala` deal with these issues by using a `WavelengthCorrection` module that allows to account for fibre-to-fibre differences and also applying additional absolute calibrations."

    "## Twilight-based wavelength corretion offset\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most relaiable calibration frames for performing a wavelength correction are the twilight flats. Ideally, these frames are completely dominated by the Sun light, that illuminates homogeneously the focal plane of the instrument. The main advantage consists of the use of the solar absorption features to perform a cross-match with some reference spectra and extract the underlying offsets on each fibre.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a nutshell, the current implemented algorithm performs the following steps:\n",
    "- Identification of absorption features in the reference solar spectra in the wavelength range covered by the twilight frame.\n",
    "- Computation of an array of weights based on the previous step, which allows the fitting to solely focus on those regions of interest.\n",
    "- Estimation of a pseudo spectral response function to correct the observed data and exclude the regions dominated by telluric absorption lines.\n",
    "- Computation of a grid of solar spectra models with varying wavelength offsets and LSF widths (assuming a gaussian profile).\n",
    "- Determination of the best fit spectra.\n",
